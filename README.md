# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2024**, an annual coding event featuring daily programming puzzles that challenge problem-solving skills and creativity.

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an online event that takes place every December, offering a series of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to December 25th. It is a great way to learn, practice, and compete with a global community of developers.
